# LLM-Based-Vehicle-Warning-Message-Advisor-with-RAG
This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied in the automotive industry to assist drivers.
It implements a context-aware chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract information from the MG ZS car manual (mg-zs-warning-messages.html).

Drivers can ask about warning messages, and the chatbot provides the meaning and recommended action directly from the manual.
The system is also Text-to-Speech (TTS) ready, enabling answers to be spoken aloud for safe, hands-free interaction inside the vehicle.
