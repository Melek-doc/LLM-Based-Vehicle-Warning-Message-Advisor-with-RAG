ðŸš˜ LLM-Based Vehicle Warning Message Advisor with RAG

This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist drivers by providing context-aware guidance using car manuals.

It integrates the MG ZS car manual (mg-zs-warning-messages.html) and implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain. The chatbot can answer questions about warning messages, their meanings, and recommended actions.

For safer hands-free use, the system can connect to a Text-to-Speech (TTS) module, allowing the assistant to read answers aloud inside the vehicle.
